# Simple To-Do List App

A basic to-do list application built with **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This app demonstrates a minimalist approach to task management using only front-end technologies, with the **Singleton Pattern** to manage the to-do list as a single shared instance.



### Design Pattern: Singleton

This app uses the **Singleton Pattern** to manage the to-do list as a single, consistent instance. This ensures that any changes to the list are immediately reflected across the app without duplicating instances.
